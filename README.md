# Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the routine measurement of cardiometabolic disease risk factors in primary care in England

## Project description

The COVID-19 pandemic reduced incident prescriptions for preventative cardiovascular disease (CVD) medicines, which could in part be related to reduced risk factor measurements. We examined to what extent the number of measurements of cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, HbA1c) were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether these have recovered to expected levels.
